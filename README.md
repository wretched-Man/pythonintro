# pythonintro
I have recently started learning python, moving from C++. So, these are the codes I have been writing while learning.
<br>
Here is a brief decripiton of what you will find in each file:
<br>
<br>
## **compare_fib.py**
<br>
Of course I learnt Fibonacci as one of the first things, like most any student. <br>
I also went ahead and learnt how to generate prime numbers up to a given `n`.
<br>
This code compares lists generated by both functions and returns elements that are common in both.
<br>
<br>
## **linkedlist.py**
<br>
I come from a background of C++ programming and I have once, for learning implemented a linked list in C++.
<br>
I wanted to try the same for Python.
<br>
<br>
This is a simple implementation of a singly linked-list in Python.
