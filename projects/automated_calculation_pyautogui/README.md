# **Auto Calculator with PyAutoGUI**
I was learning PyAutoGUI for use with OpenCV. While at it, I decided to try a project.

In this project, I use the Windows 10 calculator to automate calculations. The code takes a mathematical expression and calculates in the calculator.

The acceptable operators are [* / - + .] with the values [0 - 9]. No equal sign is accepted/needed since it is pressed automatically at the end of the input.

A delay of 10 seconds is given and then the result is cleared.

The program runs as long as the 'clear (C)' key is visible.

Versitility has been added so that the size of the application does not matter -- this, however, has not been properly tested.
